    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am Mario Rivas, a 21-year-old Computer Science major. I grew up and still live in Norwalk, California. 
        I am currently a student at Cerritos College and plan to transfer to CSULB. My dad was born in El Salvador 
        but grew up in the United States, and my mom was born and raised in Mexico. I am also the youngest of three siblings.
    </p>

    <h2>When I have free time</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>I like working out</li>
        <li>Playing video games</li>
        <li>Painting</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        My favorite website is <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/">TikTok</a> because I use it as a search engine alternative 
        to Google or YouTube. For example, the other day at the gym, I wanted to figure out which workout to do and the 
        proper form. With a simple search, I found a video demonstrating the exercise I needed.
