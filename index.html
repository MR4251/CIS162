            <p>
                I am Mario Rivas, a 21-year-old Computer Science major. I grew up and still live in Norwalk, California. 
                I am currently a student at Cerritos College and plan to transfer to CSULB.

                My dad was born in El Salvador but grew up in the United States, and my mom was born and raised in Mexico.
                I am also the youngest of three siblings.
